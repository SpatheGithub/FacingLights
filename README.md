# FacingLights
This project is a pcb with two LEDs, one push button, two resistors, and one battery. The LED's are the eyes in a cuphead of endless thought. That is why the triangles and boxy silkscreen are on top of this space. Showing how dynamic and everchanging the thoughts of someone who thinks in a reverse pyramid are. 
2x Led
